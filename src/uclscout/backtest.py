"""Replay completed seasons to test a DECISION policy.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT TEST
-----------------------------
The archive gives real per-matchday POINTS, price and ownership, but component
stats (goals, minutes, recoveries) only as season-final totals. So this harness
tests transfer/captaincy/chip DECISIONS against real scoring. It cannot train a
component model, and it must never touch the season-final columns.

LEAK DISCIPLINE -- the rule everything here obeys
-------------------------------------------------
At matchday t the policy may see:
  * md_points for matchdays STRICTLY BEFORE t
  * value and selected_pct AS OF t (both are pre-deadline facts)
  * position, club
It may NOT see:
  * md_points at t or later
  * `season_total_points` or any other season-final column -- those are the
    final answer sitting in the same row, and using one at MD1 would leak the
    whole season. `_legal_view` drops them outright rather than trusting a
    caller to remember.

Only 2024-25 and 2025-26 have usable per-matchday scoring, so the discipline is
the same as the FPL project's: tune on 2024-25, touch 2025-26 once.

MEASURED RESULTS (2026-09-08), Elo fitted only on seasons strictly before the
one being replayed:

                        crowd template   model    gain
    tune     2024-25              924    1008      +84
    validate 2025-26             1023    1107      +84      <- one shot
    perfect hindsight ceiling   1472 / 1390

The gain transferred exactly. That is the bar this project should hold itself
to: the FPL project's equivalent change gained +349 on its tuning season and
+9 on holdout, which is how a tuning artefact looks.

WHAT THE SWEEP ACTUALLY SHOWED, and it is not what I expected:

    ownership only                          924
    + "is this club even playing"          1016   <- the dominant signal
    Elo gap WITHOUT is-playing              907   <- worse than nothing
    all three                              1049

1. Crowd ownership is a strong baseline and beat my first form-based policy
   outright (956 vs 735). Do not ship a form-chaser.
2. Knowing which clubs are still IN the competition is worth more than any
   rating. From MD9 the field halves repeatedly and an eliminated club scores
   zero forever.
3. Elo is worth a real but modest +33 ON TOP of availability, and is actively
   harmful without it -- it happily rates a strong eliminated club highly.

CAVEAT, and it is a big one: this harness tests the DECISION layer only. The
archive has no per-matchday minutes, so ownership is standing in for
availability information that the live pipeline gets directly from pStatus and
the fixture feed. Do NOT port the ownership weight into the live model on this
evidence alone -- there it would double-count. What transfers is the ordering
of what matters: availability first, fixtures second, form a distant third.
