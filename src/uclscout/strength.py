"""Team strength from UEFA's own historical results.

The seeding pot (1-4) that `project.py` started with is a season-start prior: it
cannot see form, a manager change, or that a Pot 3 club is actually good. This
module replaces it with Elo fitted on real Champions League results.

WHY NOT ClubElo: its Fixtures API returns "Fixtures API deactivated" and the
per-club endpoint 502s (checked 2026-09-08). Only the HTML site responds, and
scraping it is a fragile dependency for something we can compute ourselves.

WHY NOT Dixon-Coles: the FPL project fitted DC per-club and a promoted side with
two clean sheets produced defence = -12.1, i.e. certainty of shutting everyone
out. Elo with a pot-based prior degrades gracefully for clubs with few matches,
which is most of them -- a club plays 8-17 UCL games a season at most.
