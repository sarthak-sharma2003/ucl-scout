"""Domestic league results, so strength.fit_elo has more than UCL's ~8-17
matches per club per season to work with.

Source: football-data.co.uk (verified, no auth, no key). Two URL layouts:
  - main leagues: one CSV per season, HomeTeam/AwayTeam/FTHG/FTAG columns.
  - AUT/NOR ("new" layout): one CSV for ALL seasons, Home/Away/HG/AG columns,
    filtered here by a Season column instead of by URL.

football-data.co.uk team names don't match UEFA's (e.g. "Ath Madrid" vs
"Atleti", "Paris SG" vs "Paris"), so results come back keyed by NAME and get
mapped to UEFA ids as a separate step -- results for an unmappable club are
dropped rather than guessed at.
